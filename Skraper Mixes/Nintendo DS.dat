Finally, an included "Easy Mode" makes the game more accessible to those not used to the game's tough difficulty level.</description>

Colored tiles rise up from a bin, and its your job to arrange them horizontally or vertically in lines of three or more of the same tile.  This causes them to disappear.

Planet Puzzle League features a wide variety of different game modes to keep even the most dedicated puzzler busy:

1.  Endless - Play forever until you fail.  The tiles rise faster over time.
2.  Clear - Remove all the blocks down to the 'CLEAR' line, buried deep down.
3.  Garbage Challenge - Garbage blocks rain down on your bin - clear as many as you can!
4.  Vs. COM - Play against the CPU.  Try to get their tiles to reach the top of the bin first!
5.  Time Attack - See how many points you can earn in two minutes.
6.  Puzzle - Either clear the preset mind-bending puzzles, or try the various missions that you are given.

Similar to Brain Age, Planet Puzzle League features a 'Daily' Mode.  Play these short games once a day to track your skill over a long period of time.  Are you getting better?  Or worse?

You can also play multiplayer modes of the game, either locally, or over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

  <game name="N+">
    <description>N+ is an enhanced version of the game N, originally a flash based browser game. Players control a small, but very agile ninja through different small areas. Next to movement, only a single button is used to jump, but this allows the ninja to run up walls, do wall jumps and cross large distances.

Levels are divided over different episodes unlocked gradually. Each level consists of a single screen with a time limit. The amount of time can be replenished by collecting golden coins, but the main goals is to activate the exit, usually by touching a specific button or opening a number of doors. Areas are filled with hazards such as spikes and droids that shoot laser or rockets. There are also obstacles such as platforms that only move in a single direction or falling damage from high platforms. Death is always instant, but the player is given an unlimited amount of tries.

The PSP version includes a mix of original levels and user-created ones with about 200 in total. There is also a level editor and unlike the Xbox 360 version these can be shared with other players. The PSP version shows the levels from a "medium" distance, while the DS version contains a far view and a close view on the screens. Physics are also slightly different in each version.

There are both competitive and cooperative game modes available in multiplayer sessions. Players can switch between the pure mode with original graphics and the plus mode with enhanced visuals. The unlockables includes victory screens, new music and new colours for the ninja.</description>

  <game name="Tetris DS">
    <description>At its base, Tetris DS is the same Tetris gameplay that's been around for years: rotate and arrange Tetriminos to create full lines and make them disappear.  However, it also has a style very different from earlier Tetris games, new play modes, and online play.

Graphically and aurally, Tetris DS is based on classic NES games.  A portion of the graphics are sprites directly ripped from Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight, Metroid, Yoshi's Cookie, and The Legend of Zelda.  Remixes of music from these games are also used.

Standard mode includes the standard endless play option, the standard "get 25 lines to win" option, and the standard versus mode where clearing multiple lines at once adds lines to the bottom of your opponents' well.

Push mode is a versus game with a twist.  The player's moves and pieces are shown on the top screen, while the opponent's are on the bottom screen, both with gravity moving towards the center.  Instead of multiple line clears adding extra lines to the bottom of your opponent's well, though, the center is pushed towards their end, giving them a smaller play area.  Push back and forth until one side loses.

Touch mode presents you with a tall uneven stack of large Tetriminos.  The goal is to nudge or rotate them by dragging or tapping on the touch screen to create full lines and eventually clear the stack.

Puzzle mode offers 200 Tetris scenarios and presents you with a number of pieces.  You choose the order and rotation of the pieces to try and empty the well.

Mission mode gives you specific goals like "Use a square block to clear a line" or "Clear 3 lines with an L piece".  Finish the mission and you'll be given another.  Don't finish the mission and several rows of random blocks will be added to the bottom of the well before being given another mission.

Catch mode has the Tetriminos falling without direct player control.  Instead, the player controls a moving core of blocks which can rotate as a whole, as well as latch on to the falling Tetriminos.  The goal is to create a square of at least 4x4, causing an explosion which keeps the size of your core small.  Lose by allowing your core to get too large, or by losing enough energy; which occurs when you allow a Tetrimino to scroll past the bottom of the screen, your rotating core smacks into and destroys a Tetrimino, or you hit a falling enemy.

Multiplayer Standard, Mission, and Push modes can be played locally using one copy of Tetris DS.  Mission allows for up to 10 players competing for a high score.  Standard allows for up to 10 players, and has an option for Mario Kart-like items to aid you or harm your enemies.  Push mode remains a one-on-one experience.  With Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, you can play a two-player Standard game without items, a four-player Standard game with items, or a two-player Push mode game.</description>

  <game name="Final Fantasy III">
    <description>In 2006, Final Fantasy III reached North American shores in an official update/remake for the Nintendo DS, finally bringing all of the main Final Fantasy entries to the United States for the first time.

Raised as an orphan by Nina and Elder Topapa in the village of Ur, Luneth, his shy friend Arc, the rebellious Refia and the brave soldier Ingus are chosen as the Four Warriors of Light to send to restore balance to the crystals, and save the world from imminent destruction.

Taking the original game which debuted on the NES, Square-Enix had updated the title with a new cinematic intro, improved graphics and a touch-screen interface to move characters and utilize selection menus. There is also Moogle Mail, a Wi-Fi feature that allows players to send messages to each other via their DS systems. The game has also some revised story elements, detailing the adventures of four friends who find each other, each with new backstories.

Final Fantasy III is a traditional turn-based RPG, which were popular back in the '80s and '90s, but introduced refinements to the genre, such as smarter battle AI. Final Fantasy III is also known for two major milestones in the history of the series: Its introduction of the cheerful Moogles, as well as the introduction of the job system, allowing characters to switch professions throughout the game for new abilities.</description>

  <game name="Bejeweled Twist">
    <description>Bejeweled Twist is a tile matching game, where the player rotates groups of four jewels to create rows and columns of three or more matching gems. In the Classic and Zen modes, the objective is to make enough matches to fill a tube at the left side of the screen to move to the next level. There's a chain meter at the top of this tube, that builds up with matches in a row multiplying the points, and making a fruit jewel appear when full. A box at the tube bottom shows the sequence of matches needed for bonus points.

Obstacles appear randomly on the game board. The coal can't be matched, but it can be exploded by one of the power-ups gems. The locked jewel is chained to its place and can't move, but it can be removed with a match. Bomb gems display the number of moves allowed before they explode, destroying the board and ending the game. They have to be matched before their counters reach zero, otherwise a revolving wheel-of-fortune appears that stops in one of two values, skulls or gems, that either detonate or disarm the bomb. This mini-game becomes more difficult every time it comes up.

The power-ups appear after making matches of four or more gems. A four jewel match creates the flame gem, that explodes when matched removing all surrounding jewels. A five jewel match creates the lightning gem, that destroys a column and a row at the same time in a cross of fire.

With the exception of Classic Mode , the other modes are unlocked with continuous playing. Zen Mode is similar to Classic, but is more relaxed without the bomb and locked jewels. Challenge Mode is a puzzle mode, where the objective is to perform a task, like removing all gems of one color, or making a number of matches in a row. In Blitz Mode, the goal is to accumulate the maximum amount of points possible within a time limit.</description>

  <game name="TrackMania DS">
    <description>The TrackMania series is now going portable with this Nintendo DS release.

Race with over 100 tracks by yourself or with your friends. The new modes exclusive to the game are 'Platform', in which you must navigate through complex levels without using too many retries, and 'Puzzle', in which you must create your own map with checkpoints and a limited number of building blocks to connect the pieces, and race to the finish, while the 'Race' mode is left intact. The game includes three environments to race: Desert (the environment used in TrackMania Original), Rally and Stadium (the environment used in TrackMania Nations).

Instead of complex racing simulators where you have to measure a correct speed to turn through narrow roads, this is an arcade-style racing game with high speeds (over 400 km/h!) and simple controls. All you have is accelerate, brake, horn and that's it! Of course, like it's PC counterparts, you can freely reset the track if you fall of the track, or if you want a better medal. There are three types of medals: bronze, silver and gold. You can either race with AI opponents or race by yourself. The main objective is to get to the finish line as fast as possible. The target time is given to you at the beginning of every track, depending on for which medal you are racing.

The game also includes a built-in map editor, which allows you to create a custom map with your stylus.</description>

The player must grow and maintain crops and build up their home, and there are also dungeons to battle and befriend monsters in. The stamina of your character still depends on the meter of rune points, and once it is depleted it will start draining the meter of health points. 

New features this time around include dynamic schedules for NPCs, the ability for NPC villagers to accompany players into dungeons and multiplayer with the ability to play dungeons with up to two other players.</description>

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground.  The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other.  The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</description>

Other major changes compared to the original 2 in the series are the ability to mutate your characters further and a change to the upgrade system. Items picked up after battle can be attached to your mutants or humans to turn them into monsters or robots, increasing your parties power and abilities. And although the original system of obtaning experience points after every battle has been removed, its replacement allows you to choose which magic stone each character can use, so they learn that specific magic type and never lose it.</description>

    <description>Many years after the events in the Mega Man Zero series, humans and Reploids (humanoid robots) have at last found peace.  Two humans, Vent and Aile, work for a delivery company called Giro Express.  After being ambushed during a delivery, they come in contact with something called 'biometal', which transforms them into the Maverick Hunter, X.  Using their new powers, they decide to work for a group called "The Guardians", who protect civilians from Maverick attacks.

Mega Man ZX is a side scrolling platformer for the Nintendo DS.  While the gameplay is similar to the Mega Man X series, in that you find powerups to increase your health meter, gain subtanks to store surplus energy when needed, and gain new abilities such as swimming and flight through acquiring boss powers, the art style is more similar to the Mega Man Zero series of games.

As players progress through the game, they gain the power of different types of "biometal", which gives them robotic weaponry and abilities.  Different situations require different biometal suits, and sometimes (such as in civilian areas), it's best to return to your human form so that you can make your way through areas without being hassled.  New models of biometal can be acquired from boss enemies.  While you can hit their weak spots for more damage, it's actually beneficial not to, as the more damage you do to the weak spot results in more repairs that you need to make to the biometal later.</description>

  <game name="Puyo Pop Fever">
    <description>Puyo Pop Fever is a puzzle game of the falling-block variety, the goal of which is to clear your blocks (Puyos) by combining four or more of the same color, which will then vanish. This will produce Nuisance Puyos. These colorless Puyos will fall onto your opponents screen, thus blocking chains and combos they could create. These pesky Puyos can only be exterminated by removing neighboring Puyos.&#xD;
When an opponent sends Nuisance Puyos to your screen you can try to "offset" by clearing your own Puyos and limiting the number that would fall on your screen. This will also increase your Fever Meter. When this meter fills you will be given a set of prearranged Puyos with which you can wrack up giant combos and send tons of Nuisance Puyos to your opponent. When any player's field becomes so full that they can no longer drop Puyos they lose the game.</description>

  <game name="Orcs &amp; Elves">
    <description>Orcs &amp; Elves is a turn-based role-playing game based on improved DOOM RPG engine. The story follows an elf named Elli who, along with a talking magic wand Ellon, heads to the depths of a devastated dwarven citadel to find out what happened there, battling foes of many kinds, finding mysterious items and meeting various people.

The game uses a first person perspective and dungeons are grid-based, similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye of the Beholder series; the player can only move between squares, forward, backward, strafe left or right, turn in 90 degree increments. Enemies and dungeon features are drawn with sprite graphics. There are some 3D objects in the dungeons as well, and the game employs some 3D camera movements in the cutscenes. The dungeons mostly consist of one level, though it is possible to move between different parts of the dungeons and revisit the previous dungeons as necessary.</description>

  <game name="Picross DS">
    <description>Picross DS is a touch screen-based puzzle game for the Nintendo DS.  By following the numbers on the left and top of the game grid, players can uncover the picture hidden away.  The rules are simple - if there is one number on a line, say, 10, then you know that there are ten squares in a row that must be chipped away on that line.  If the numbers read something like 2 7, then you must chip away two squares somewhere in the row, separated by at least one empty square, and then seven squares to be chipped away.  By applying these rules horizontally and vertically to the grid, you can work out the picture using logic.

There are two methods of control: you can use the Control Pad to move a cursor, the A Button to chip a square, the B Button to mark it, and the X Button to zoom in or out (similar to Nintendo's previous Picross games).  Alternatively, you can use the stylus to play.  In this mode, the Control Pad changes the functions of the stylus.  When you press Up, you'll chip squares, Down will mark them, Left will zoom in and out, while Right allows you to scroll.  The buttons on the right of the DS perform the same functions, which is helpful if you're left-handed.

Picross DS has a variety of different modes:

1.  Picross - This is standard Picross.  Play through easy, medium and difficult puzzles, or learn how to play.  You are penalized with time for any mistakes you make in easy and medium modes.  In difficult, your mistakes are not noted at all.

2.  Daily Picross - Play a quick set of five Picross puzzles, once a day.  Each day, your score is added to a chart, so you can track whether you're improving or getting worse, similar to Brain Age.

3.  My Picross - Design your own Picross puzzles by drawing on the grid.  When you're done, you can play your puzzles, or send them to others.

4.  Competition Picross - Play Picross against others in this mode.  You can choose to use single-cart multiplayer, multi-cart multiplayer, or online play via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.

You can also download additional puzzle packs for Picross DS by using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, including puzzles from Mario's Picross.</description>

You will race through the levels collecting rings, using "gimmicks" such as bungee ropes and giant waterwheels, performing tricks, collecting power-ups, and defeating enemies.

During the course of the story, the player controls a party made up of orphans who have been raised by the Luminous church.

Also, relationships with characters may be strengthened during post-fight "intermissions," leading to some bonuses in future battles.</description>

They plunge into the murky depths of the ocean...and awaken on a small island.  A local, a raccoon named Marine, informs them that they are on Southern Island.  With Marine and Tails' help, Sonic sets about to explore the nearby islands.

Sonic Rush Adventure is a side-scrolling adventure game, and the sequel to Sonic Rush.  Sonic's goal through these platform levels is to zip through as quickly as possible.  By pressing the B Button while in the air, Sonic can increase his Tension Gauge by performing aerial tricks. Pressing Y uses a Super Boost, which will allow him to plow through anything in his path at amazing speed, but drains the Tension Gauge.

When Sonic reaches the treasure chest at the end of each level, he will be given a material that can be used for construction of ships and other devices.  At first, Sonic is stranded on Southern Island, but after the construction of the waterbike, he can travel to other islands and explore them.  Similar to The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, the player must plot a path to the next island using the stylus, and then provide limited control over the ship as it travels.  However, Sonic has different ships, each of which are notably different from Link's steamboat.

Sonic Rush Adventure also features a Battle Mode, where players can either play locally with a friend, or across the world through Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection.  Players can take each other on in a one-on-one race through various levels as each player aims to get to the end first.</description>
