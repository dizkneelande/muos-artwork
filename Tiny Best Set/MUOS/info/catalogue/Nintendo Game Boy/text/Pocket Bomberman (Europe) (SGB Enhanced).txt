In contrast to the overhead view of other Bomberman titles, Pocket Bomberman features sidescrolling platformer gameplay. Like other Bomberman games, Bomberman must defeat all enemies in each stage to advance. The game features a total of 5 worlds spanning 25 levels. Each world follows a different theme, including forest, underwater, cloudtops and a dark underworld. At the end of each world is a boss fight. There is one mini game called Jump Mode in which players must guide Bomberman through an Easy, Medium, or Hard course. Bomberman will constantly jump and the player can only place bombs in this mode.
