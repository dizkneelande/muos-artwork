You've finally been granted your Pokémon trainer's license. Now, it's time to head out to become the world's greatest Pokémon trainer. It's going to take all you've got to collect 150 Pokémon in this enormous world. Catch and train monsters like the shockingly-cute Pikachu. Face off against Blastoise's torrential water cannons. Stand strong when facing Pidgeot's stormy Gust. Trade with friends and watch your Pokémon evolve. Important - no single Pokémon can win it all. Can you develop the ultimate Pokémon strategy to defeat the eight GYM Leaders and become the greatest Pokémon Master of all time? 
 
* Collect up to 139 different Pokémon playing the Red version. Using the Game Link cable, trade with a friend who has the Blue version to capture all 150. 
* You'll need to use both versions (Red and Blue) to collect all of the Pokémon. 
* Test your training skills by battling against a friend using the Game Link cable. 
* Save your Pokémon and game progress on the Game Pak memory.
