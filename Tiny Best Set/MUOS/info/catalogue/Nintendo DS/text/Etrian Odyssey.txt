Etrian Odyssey is a first-person, dungeon exploration game created by Atlus for the Nintendo DS. The game contains many classic RPG elements such as random battles, leveling up, and a host of things to find and collect. However, Etrian Odyssey is unique in the fact that as you explore the labyrinth, you must create a map of each floor entirely yourself using the stylus and the bottom screen of the Nintendo DS, similar to older games such as Wizardry, where players often created their own maps of the dungeon on graph paper.
