Jump Ultimate Stars is more or less an expanded version of the original game, Jump Super Stars. It features the same Super Smash Bros.-style fighting gameplay with a plethora of licensed manga characters, bringing in a wide variety of new franchises and characters. The roster has been expanded to more than 300 characters from 41 different manga titles. There is also Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support, making global internet play a possibility. Generally, the game is structured the same as the previous title. The player sets up decks made up of the three types of panels, which can be used on the fly with the touchscreen. There is a story mode, versus modes, several single-player modes, as well as a quiz mode and information archives and story synopses for each series. The method of obtaining new panels has changed, however: each character has a progress tree, and successful battles earn gems which can be spent to power up different characters.
