Game & Watch Collection is a compilation cartridge featuring three of Nintendo's Multi-Screen Game & Watch games. Not available for purchase, this game could only be obtained through the customer loyalty program, Club Nintendo. The included games are: Oil Panic: Oil is dripping from the ceiling! Catch the oil in your bucket, then tip it out the window to your friend holding the oil barrel. Don't spill any oil! Donkey Kong: A giant ape has kidnapped your girlfriend! Climb to the top of the construction site to rescue her. Dodge barrels as you climb, then pull out the girder's pins to defeat Donkey Kong. Green House: Look after the four plants in your green house. Spray any bugs with your bug spray, and don't forget about the spiders on the lower levels! Each Game & Watch game can function as a clock by using the internal clock of the Nintendo DS. An alarm can also be set through the game's main menu.
