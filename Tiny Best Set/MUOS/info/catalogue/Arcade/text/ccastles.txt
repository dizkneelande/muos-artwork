Bentley Bear is trapped in the crystal castles! To get out, he must collect all the gems located in each castle. The game is played in a false 3D isometric view through multi-platform castles. When Bentley collects all the gems in the level, he moves on to the next, more difficult castle. Bentley will have to avoid a wide variety of dangerous creatures that roam the levels. Occasionally a magic hat will appear. If Bentley collects the hat, he will be temporarily invincible.
