This arcade game has a few monsters that are playable, a few that can't be played as and a few that make cameos. All playable monsters in the 1 Player game (except for the one you play as) have many more abilities than what can be accessed in Battle Mode. All monsters can jump, jump and kick/punch, do a tail swipe, grab and throw, punch and kick, and block. Most have a beam weapon, though some don't. All playable monsters have alternate colors to distinguish between the same monster in muliplayer mode.
