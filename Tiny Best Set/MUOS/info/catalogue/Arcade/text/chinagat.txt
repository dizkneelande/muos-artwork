China Gate is a 2D side-scrolling beat 'em-up game with platform elements for one or two players. The game offers a roster of three characters to choose from who have to recover a stolen book. These are the monkey man Gocoo, pig man Hakai and bird man Gojou. There are 3 buttons, one to jump, another to attack and another for power-ups. There is a limited time to defeat the numerous enemies that appear and jump through the platforms to harm the player. At the end of each level there is final boss. It is possible to obtain power-ups like beams that neutralize all the visible enemies of the screen.
