For all you King of Fighters fans, SNK offers the ultimate KOF installment! A total of 38 of your favorite fighters from all the characters appearing in the '94 to '97 versions. The nostalgic American Sports team, Lugal, as well as Heidern, Takuma, Saishu Kusanagi and other long-awaited characters are back!

THE ADVANTAGE SYSTEM HEATS UP THE COMPETITION 
During battles, if one of your team members lose, you gain the systematic advantage with KOF '98's revolutionary game system. In the Advanced Mode, each player gets up to three power stock items. The second player can get up to four, and the third player up to five. In the Extra Mode, the length of the power gauge decreases progressively with the second and third players to make building up power easier. 
 
THE EXCITING, ADRENALIN-FUELED ROULETTE TEAM EDIT MODE 
Use the roulette wheel to select team members at random. You can select one to three members with the roulette wheel! As a team wins, the roulette wheel spins again. Who will join your team is up to fate!
