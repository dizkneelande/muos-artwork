Stakes Winner 2 is a sports game in which you get in the saddle to compete in horse races in Europe and the United States. Accelerating and sprinting at the right time while managing the horse's fatigue are the keys to a good performance. If you win, use your winnings to buy accessories and become even better at it. The handling is a bit smoother than in the first episode. The realisation is also a bit better, although the game is still very close to the first one.
