The Demon's Crest consists of six magical stones that when combined will give the holder power to rule all. The inhabitants of the Demon Realm had long fought for possession of this infinite power until one gargoyle emerged victorious: the red demon known as Firebrand. At the end of his final battle, Firebrand was ambushed by his nemesis, Phalanx, and the stones are stolen. 
 
Now, Firebrand must recover the stones before humans and demons fall under Phalanx's sinister rule. Breathe fire, claw walls, and hover across seven intense levels of the Demon Realm. Gain new transformations and abilities as you fight your way through Phalanx's forces. With three different endings to experience, twenty-five hidden items to discover, and six magical stones of cosmic power to control, can you save the realms from total anarchy?
