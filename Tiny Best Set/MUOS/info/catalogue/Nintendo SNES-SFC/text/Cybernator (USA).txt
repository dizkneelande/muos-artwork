In the year 2065 AD, the nations of Earth have split into two major powers: the Axis and the Federation. These governing bodies are constantly at war for land, which has even extended into the frontiers of space. 
 
Jake is a soldier for the Pacific States' Marine Corp and pilots his own Assault Suit for the Federation. He has been assigned to lead a covert strike team to confront the Axis troops head-on. Your Assault Suit is ready for battle and can jump, shoot, and hover over small distances. Battle through seven war zones, and capture power-ups for upgrades and new weapons. Complete your mission objectives as the fight takes you through Earth's fragile ecosystem, to the moon, and across the vast expanse of space!
