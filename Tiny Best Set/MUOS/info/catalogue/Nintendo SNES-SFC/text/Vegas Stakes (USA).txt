Stake your claim in Vegas and beat the house! Let your inner high roller go wild as you try your luck at five different casino games—black jack, slots, poker, craps, and roulette. Start with $1,000 in your pocket and play your way through five casinos, each with a different theme and varying limits. Choose one of four friends to tag along and offer advice when you need it. Further enhancing the experience is the fact that you'll be presented with a slew of interactions with random casino patrons. Be careful though, your choices in these situations could either get you closer to the millions of dollars you're after, or cost you a pile of that hard-earned cash.
