P.T.O. II: Pacific Theater of Operations is a turn-based strategy game. The second episode of the series, this one builds on the strengths of the first, adding three big new scenarios and seven shorter ones. All battles take place once again during the Second World War conflict and more precisely in the Pacific Ocean. As in the previous episode, you will have to manage your entire army and annihilate the enemy forces. Note that once again, you can play with a second player.
