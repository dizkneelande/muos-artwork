Thunderhawk is an action game on Mega-CD that gives you control of a combat helicopter in a series of six futuristic campaigns. The original version includes a total of 60 operations with various objectives. Before flying in the sky, the player can adapt the embarked arsenal to suit it. Piloting is technical but accessible, without being as complex as other simulations available in 1993.
