The ruthless emperor of Paramekia leads his demonic armies across the land, laying waste to all in his path. One by one the nations fall, and those without the will to resist are forced into servitude. When the conflict reaches the borders of Phin, its people choose to fight, and are all but annihilated. After the loss of Castle Phin, the survivors flee to nearby Althea, where the rebellion makes a temporary headquarters. 
 
Among the survivors are Frioniel, Maria, and Guy; rescued by the rebel leader Princess Hilda and the white mage Ming-wu. Though young and implusive, they gain Hilda's trust and are allowed to join her battle against the empire. While the road ahead may be paved with loss and sacrifice, each victory brings them closer to reclaiming their homeland.
