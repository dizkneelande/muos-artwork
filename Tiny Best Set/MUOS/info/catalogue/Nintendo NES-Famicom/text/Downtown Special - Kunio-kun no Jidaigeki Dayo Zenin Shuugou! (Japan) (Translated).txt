Downtown Special: Kunio-kun no Jidaigeki da yo Zenin Shugo! is a beat 'em up set in medieval Japan using the same engine as River City Ransom. 
This is the Sixth NES Episode of the prolific "Nekketsu Koha Kunio-kun" series which can roughly be translated as "Nekketsu High School Thug Kunio" and which has brought over a dozen titles to the NES (Renegade, Nintendo World Cup, Crash 'n the Boys: Street Challenge, etc.). 
Bunzo, Kunio's sensei has been affected by a mysterious illness. Kunio and his brother Tsuu must go in search of Kanpou to cure him, but many adventures will occur on the road.
