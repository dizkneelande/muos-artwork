Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is an action-platform video game that features eight side-scrolling levels and four boss encounters. The player can use multiple weapons to defeat enemies, ranging from a pistol to a shotgun, a grenade launcher, and a bow and arrow. In some levels, the player must ride a Pterodactylus or a canoe while avoiding opponents. The game employs a password system to prevent the loss of progress. Although the game is set in the same world as its Nintendo 64 counterpart, it features a different storyline. The story follows protagonist Joshua Fireseed and his attempts to stop the Amaranthine Accordance villains from bringing a massive Dinosoid army from the Lost World to Earth.
