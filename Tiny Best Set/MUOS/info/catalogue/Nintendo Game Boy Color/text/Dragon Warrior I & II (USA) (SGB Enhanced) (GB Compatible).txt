One of the great traditions in mythology is the story of the lone adventurer conquering evil in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds. The first installment in the Dragon Warrior series throws you into the fray with little more than a horned helmet, the clothes on your back and the generosity of Alefgard's citizens. As you move from town to town, fighting monsters and collecting gold, the details of your mission to defeat the Dragonlord will begin to unfold. 
 
Dragon Warrior II 
The second quest takes place many years after the defeat of the Dragonlord. An era of peace and tranquility has been broken by the monstrous armies of Hargon, who invade Moonbrook Castel to assassinate the King. As the Prince of Lorasia, you'll need to travel the countryside in search of like-minded adventurers then set off as a party to stop Hargon from resurrecting an evil entity.
