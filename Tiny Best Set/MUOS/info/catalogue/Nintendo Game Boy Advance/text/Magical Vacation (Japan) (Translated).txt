Magical Vacation is one of the Game Boy Advance's earliest RPGs and it was also Brownie Brown's very first game after they completed Legend of Mana and left Squaresoft. Magical Vacation is a prequel of sorts to the Nintendo DS game "Magical Starsign." 
 
Brownie Brown would later go on to do Sword of Mana and Mother 3 on the GBA. The game never saw an overseas release and is one of the few gems on the Game Boy Advance that is Japanese exclusive.
