Max Payne lost his family to death. Now he is seeking revenge. In the lore of the original PC hit, Max Payne on the Game Boy Advance follows Max's story as he attempts to take down the crime lords who tried to destroy his life. 
 
Unlike the original, the GBA version uses an isometric perspective to present the action. Various weapons are offered to dispatch the guys (or girls) who get in your way, and by using bullet time, you can slow down time and increase your chances of avoiding incoming fire and hitting the target.
