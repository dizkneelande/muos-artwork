This story takes place in a land ruled by and intended for kids: the Ketchup Kingdom. On the holiday, Tomato Day, King Abiira makes an important announcement, declaring a rebirth of the nation with the help of the six Super Kids, and unveiling an awesome machine, the Super Cara-Cooker.

Unfortunately, just after the machine is unveiled, the TV of a boy named Demiru blows out. The adventure begins when you take control of Demiru, and set out to have your TV repaired..."

Tomato Adventure is a very cute and unique RPG meant for young kids, and is currently only available in Japan. It's fairly simple compared to the more complex RPGs out there. But I still think it's very fun; it reminds me a lot of Super Mario RPG.
