Unlike some of the saga's opuses, Super Robot Taisen: Original Generation contains only original creations from its developer Banpresto. The player can start this episode by embodying one of the two proposed protagonists, each with its own scenario. For the first time in the series, the player can customize his robots and choose their equipment and weapons.
