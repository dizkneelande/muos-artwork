Colony Wars: Red Sun (called Colony Wars III: Red Sun in North America) is a space combat simulator video game for the PlayStation developed and released by Psygnosis in 2000. Other two episodes were released beforehand, namely Colony Wars in 1997 and Colony Wars: Vengeance in 1998. 
 
Instead of being a starfighter pilot for the League of Free Worlds or the Colonial Navy, the player now assumes the role of a civilian miner-turned-mercenary.
