After being defeated by the good-natured Robbit, the diabolical Baron Aloha has retreated to his private island, Little Muu. Along with his army of MuuMuu creatures, he figured he was finally safe from his arch-nemesis. He figured wrong... 
 One day, Baron was visited by the planet-sized monster known as Kaptain Kabuki. This behemoth roams the galaxies and bottles up planets for his collection; kind of like ships-in-a-bottle. Baron may be an evil bad guy with a chemical imbalance, but he is no fool! He quickly got the heck out of dodge and made an ironic call for help; he called Robbit!
