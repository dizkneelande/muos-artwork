Persona 2: Innocent Sin is similar in structure and basic gameplay to its predecessor. Much of the game consists of navigating a party of up to five active combatants through locations in the large city, exploring complex dungeons, and fighting randomly appearing demons in round-based style. Unlike the first game, dungeons are viewed from an angled overhead perspective with rotatable camera. Rather than having the option of using either a melee weapon or a gun, each character is equipped with his or her own specific weapon.
