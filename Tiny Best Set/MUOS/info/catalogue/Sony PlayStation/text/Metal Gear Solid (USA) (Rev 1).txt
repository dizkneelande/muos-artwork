Renegade special forces unit FOXHOUND has taken over Shadow Moses Island in Alaska's Fox Archipelago - publicly a nuclear weapons disposal facility but in truth a top secret weapons development site and home to Metal Gear REX. 
 
With the help of the genetically engineered Next Generation Special Forces, Liquid Snake has seized the facility, taken hostages and hijacked REX, demanding the US Government give them One Billion Dollars and the remains of legendary soldier Big Boss. 
 
Returning from retirement, former FOXHOUND operative Solid Snake has been tasked with infiltrating the island on a solo mission to free the hostages and stop his former unit before they can launch a nuclear attack.
