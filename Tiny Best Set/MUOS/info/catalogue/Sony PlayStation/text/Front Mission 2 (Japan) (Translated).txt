The player assumes the role of an OCU Wanzer squad in 22nd century Aroldesh. One night while on routine patrol, the OCU base is infiltrated and attacked. Civil war is now loosed upon the nation of Aroldesh as a coup d'etat is staged.  

Front Mission 2 is the first 3D title in the strategy/RPG series and the first to hit the Playstation. An isometric view is used to navigate your Wanzers (mech) on the battlefield.  When the player engages an enemy the view switches to a 3rd-person perspective which shows the results of the battle. Between missions you can upgrade your Wanzer and talk with NPCs who will move the story forward. The game features over 30 missions and dozens of skills and weapons to outfit your crew with.
