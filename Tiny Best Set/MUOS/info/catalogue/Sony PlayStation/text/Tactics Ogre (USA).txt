After generations of war between the various ethnic groups, King Dogare brought peace to the land of Valeria. When the king dies Valeria is split into three different groups, each claiming the throne. You take the role of a young boy as he embarks on a quest to save the land from turmoil and assume the throne. You will have to journey throughout the land and recruit members for an army. Once recruited, the members will gain experience through the turn-based battles.  
 
Up to 10 party members can participate in any battle. Eventually, the characters can change classes and learn skills that are specific to each class. However, you will have to make sure your party is balanced or you will face certain doom. Will you be able to save the world from chaos in Tactics Ogre?
