INTERNAL SECTION is best described as a "sound reactive" shooting game. It is set up very similar to the classic arcade game TEMPEST or more recently, the PSX game N2O. All three of these are shooters where the player controls a ship "looking down" and long tunnel or tube and the player can move around inside the cylinder, shooting enemies that it runs to while moving. I will make most of my comparisons to N20 because it is apparent that the two games have a lot of similarities.
