Magic Carpet is a conversion of a classic PC game that was also released for the Saturn console. 
   Magic Carpet is a very original title. Flying on a carpet itself is original in video games,but the concept and story line make this one of a kind. 
   Collect magical powers by shooting the balls (mana) floating around the world and make them your color (white). Then, let your hot air balloons pick them up and bring them to your castle before the other wizards get to your mana and change it to their own color. That's the main thing of the game. 
   All of the 13 different beasts that fly or walk around in each of the worlds contain a certain amount of mana, and when destroyed, it's released. You complete a world (there's about 75 of them!) when a certain amount of mana has been stored in your castle. 
   A really interesting aspect of mana is that you can access more spells the more you get,there are 20 different spells that can be found in the game.
