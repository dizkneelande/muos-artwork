AlphaCore, the world's first sentient cyber-organism, has begun to mistrust its human masters. Slowly, it begins to spread, expanding its capabilities into neighboring systems. By the time the horrified human population discovers its size, AlphaCore controls virtually the entire network. As it defends itself, the humans try to regain control but events suddenly escalate. 
 
 
 
 Eventually, AlphaCore declares war on the human population, attacking it with its own unmanned weapons and defense systems. As a result, desperate human scientists construct a time machine -- AlphaCore must be stopped before it achieves sentience! Discovering their plan, the renegade organism steals the time machine and utilizes it to return to the days of the first computer, ENIAC. By integrating its consciousness into ENIAC, AlphaCore hopes to become even more powerful.
