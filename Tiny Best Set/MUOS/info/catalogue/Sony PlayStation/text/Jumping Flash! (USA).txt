What would the video game industry be without mad, evil scientists such as Baron Aloha that want to take over the world? We'd have fewer games, that's for sure! Anyway, if this guy carries out his plans, the whole universe will suffer under his menacing wrath. Fortunately, help is on the way. Yes, a giant mechanical rabbit, aptly named Robbit, is here to save the day. And of course, you are Robbit and must go around the world of Jumping Flash! collecting the missing "jetpods" and stop Baron Aloha. 
 Jumping Flash! is a first person shooter set in a graphically stunning 3D universe. To stop Aloha, you must tackle and hop (well, you ARE a big mechanical bunny) your way through 6 worlds divided into 18 different levels, pick up various special weapons, blast little critters that try to get in your way and find the missing jetpods.
