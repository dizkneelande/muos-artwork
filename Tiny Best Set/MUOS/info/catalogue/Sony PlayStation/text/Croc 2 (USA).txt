The loveable Croc is back in Croc 2, the sequel to the original PlayStation hit from Fox Interactive. After he and his Gobbo friends returned home, they thought the whole ordeal with Baron Dante was over with. Little do they know, the evil Dantinis are planning the evil villain's return. Meanwhile, Croc's life changed one day after discovering a bottled up message lying on the beach. The writers of the letter stated they were searching for their long-lost crocodile son. Thinking they could be his parents, Croc took the letter to King Rufus who suggested he journey to a faraway land, seek out the help of other Gobbos, and find his folks. The Gobbos then built a seesaw catapult to launch Croc to the foreign land, kick-starting his latest adventure.
