Macross was a very popular mecha show made in the 1980s. It is better known in the states as Robotech. Macross, do you remember love is based on the movie version of the show. It is a compressed version made in the 1990. 
 The game had a solid mix of 2D and 3D action and special effects that added depth to its gameplay, and lastly it was released on 2 CDs as it contained footage and sounds of the movie. The footage contained new scenes that showed Hikaru Ichijyo and his fellow pilots still on Earth flying on their way to the SDF-1 Macross which made a space fold jump just in time before the Zentradi's massive attack reached them. There are also several completely re-animated scenes, and some scenes that have been done completely with computer animation, such as the transformation of the SDF-1.
