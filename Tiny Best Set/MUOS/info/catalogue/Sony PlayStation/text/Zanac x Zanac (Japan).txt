Zanac X Zanac was released to celebrate the Compile's 15th anniversary of the release of its classic NES game, Zanac. 
Zanac is an arcade-style who players fly a lone starfighter, dubbed the AFX-6502 Zanac, through twelve levels; their goal is to destroy the System?a part-organic, part-mechanical entity bent on destroying Mankind. 
Zanac differs from other vertical shooters in its ability to adapt to your strengths and to adjust the game to attack your weaknesses. Your performance during the game and your choice of subweapon will partially determine what and how much Zanac will send at you.
