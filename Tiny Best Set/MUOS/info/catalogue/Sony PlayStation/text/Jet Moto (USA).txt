Developed by SingleTrac, Jet Moto blends futuristic motocross racing with hazard ridden tracks. Rather than using traditional cars or motorcycles, these vehicles are a cross between jet skis and hovercrafts. With turbo-charged engines, these bikes can tread water, perform dangerous aerial flips and catch serious air. There are 20 vehicles/characters in all, each with varying acceleration times, weight, suspension (lift) and handling capabilities. 
 While there's only a handful of tracks readily available, there are nine in all -- the latter courses will be unlocked by doing well in tournaments. Spanning the globe, tracks are set throughout snowy mountains and ice, massive cliffs, murky swamps and vibrant beaches. Located throughout each course are magnetic pillars in which you can grapple and handle turns in a more sufficient manner.
