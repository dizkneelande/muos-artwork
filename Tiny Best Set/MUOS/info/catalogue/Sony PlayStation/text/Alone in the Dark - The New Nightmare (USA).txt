His good friend, private investigator Edward Carnby, has chartered a plane to Shadow Island to investigate the disappearance of his friend and discover what the island's owner, Obed Morton, is planning. Ailene Cedrac, an ethnology Professor at Boston University, also has an interest in the island -- she believes that her long lost father is located there.
