Jet Moto 2 (known as Jet Moto '98 in Japan) was released exclusively for the PlayStation video game console in 1997. The game became downloadable from the Playstation Network in January, 2008. The selectable amount of characters for this game was halved in comparison to the first game, with ten characters available at the beginning of the game and one unlockable character. Track amounts were greatly increased, however, with ten new tracks, and unlockable tracks from the original game. Tracks are more varied this time with each level containing a unique theme rather than the shared themes of the original game.
