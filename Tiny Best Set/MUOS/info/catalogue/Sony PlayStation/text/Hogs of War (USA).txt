Hogs of War is a turn-based tactics video game developed by Infogrames Studios and published by Infogrames Europe. The game is set in a First World War-era where anthropomorphic pigs engage in combat. Play proceeds in a turn-based fashion, with 3D graphics, vehicles, a career-based single-player mode, and voice-over work (both narration and for characters) by British comedian Rik Mayall.
