Rakugaki Showtime you play as a rakugaki (scribble) character, who must fight against other rakugaki characters in a square 3D arena. The fights mainly consist of throwing items at the opposition. However, throwing is not as simple as "pick up, aim & throw". In Rakugaki Showtime different "drives" can be placed on the thrown items by holding different directions whilst throwing. Holding the direction towards the target will cause a "Forward Drive Throw", which is like a faster normal throw, albeit weaker. Holding the direction away from the target will cause you to do a "Backward Drive Throw", which will cause your character to throw the item slower and in an arc, but it will cause far more damage.
