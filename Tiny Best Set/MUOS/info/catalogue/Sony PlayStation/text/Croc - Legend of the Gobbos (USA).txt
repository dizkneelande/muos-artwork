In Croc, you play Croc (ironically enough), a lively crocodile who was raised by the Gobbos. Jealous of their happiness, the evil Baron Dante took over the Gobbos Valley and enslaved all of them. Beany the Bird was able to help Croc escape and now he must free the Gobbos from their enslavement. Croc: Legend of the Gobbos has five stages that are broken into 40 levels. A total of nine bosses exist along with an entire host of evil creatures who must be overcome on your way to defeating Baron Dante. In the game you will be required to perform precision platform jumping during exploration through a 3D world. You can choose between three camera angles which but the camera rotates on its own as you move. There once was a village of super-cute animals known as the gobbos. One day, a basket washed onto the shore of the village, and inside it was a baby crocodile.
