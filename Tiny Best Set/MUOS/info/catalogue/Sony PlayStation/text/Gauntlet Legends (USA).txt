"Wizard is about to die." 
 Wait just a minute -- we all know that good wizards never die, they just teleport to another dimension! Such is the case with Gauntlet Legends, the 1998 Arcade update to the original 1985 coin-op game that featured four-player simultaneous action set within a fantasy setting. The four character classes (warrior, wizard, valkyrie and archer) have returned in full 3D, but this time they have a few friends! Yet before you can use the new characters, you'll have to first find them during the course of play.
