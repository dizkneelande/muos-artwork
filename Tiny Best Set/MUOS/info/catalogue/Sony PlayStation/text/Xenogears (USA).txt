After losing his memory, Fei Fong Wong found himself in the small town of Lahan. Because he couldn't remember who he really was or where he came from, he decided to stay there and teach martial arts and paint -- one of his personal hobbies. After his arrival, he became friends with the various townsfolk, who in return treated him like one of their own. Still, who he was and what happened to him in his past bothered him; he was afraid it would come back to haunt him one of these days. 
   And it did. One day, an organization in control of large Gears, mechanized robots built for war purposes, came into the small town of Lahan. Fei was at the center of attention and with no hesitation jumped into a nearby Gear and started fighting back. The villagers were scared to death as he began to destroy the threatening enemies; he also aided in the destruction of the town. Enraged at the way he had handled himself, the townsfolk exiled Fei from the village with his only friend being an inventor named Citan.
