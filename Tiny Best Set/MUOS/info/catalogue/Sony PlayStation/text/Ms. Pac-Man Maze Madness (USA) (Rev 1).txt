Pac-Land is protected by the four gems of virtue: Generosity, Truth, Wisdom, and Courage. These four gems are scattered in the four Wonders of Pac-Land, mystical regions separated from Pac-Land by mysterious force fields. The gems are in place to keep darkness and chaos from falling on Pac-Land. 
 Recently, someone has invaded the Enchanted Castle, kidnapping the princess and turning it into a haunted house. Professor Pac believes that whoever is responsible for that attack is planning to attack the rest of the four Wonders. Therefore, he has created a device that allows for someone to pass through the force field separating Pac-Land from the wonders. With this device you, Ms. Pac-Man, must recover the four gems and save Pac-Land. 
 Ms. Pac-Man: Maze Madness is a 3D isometric view action puzzle game. You play as Ms. Pac-Man and must navigate the mazes while avoiding the monsters. Every time a monster touches or hits you part of your health bar is lost, and if you lose your entire health bar the game is over. If you eat a power dot you will be invincible for a short period of time, and can even eat the monsters. 
 The game is composed of a series of theme levels, with each level having four gold stars to collect. You can collect a gold star by completing the level, eating all of the dots in the level, eating all seven hidden fruit in the level, or completing the level's time trial. These stars can then be used to unlock the game's secrets. The original Ms. Pac-Man arcade game is also included on the disc.
