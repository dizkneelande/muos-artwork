In the past, a terrible war raged between the Gods, the creators of the world, and the Titans. The Titans were defeated thanks to a super-powerful weapon forged by the Gods, called the Golden Axe. Thanks to this weapon, the Titans were banished, and the Gods bequeathed the Earth to humans. However, one Titan had survived: Death Adder. He seized the Golden Axe and used it to lay waste to the world. He kidnapped the king of Yuria and his daughter and threatened to execute them if the inhabitants did not submit unconditionally. Three heroes, determined to take revenge on Death Adder, set out to find him. 
Each character has a special magical ability that can be charged by kicking small creatures that drop a potion.
