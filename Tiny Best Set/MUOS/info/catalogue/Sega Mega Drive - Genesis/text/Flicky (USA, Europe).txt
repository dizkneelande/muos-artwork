The premise of Flicky is dramatically simple: the chick has to face a succession of fixed boards (which form an infinite loop around themselves) full of platforms. The other inhabitants of the board are a variable number of tiny chicks, a kitten called Tiger and an iguana called Iggy. The objective is of course to collect all the chicks and get them to the exit while avoiding Tiger and Iggy. Once taken under your wing, the chicks will follow you in single file. If Tiger or Iggy manage to hit one of the chicks, it will stop following you and you will have to retrieve it. If the two predators catch Flicky, they eat him, simple as that. The only way Flicky can get rid of his feline and reptilian pursuers is by picking up certain items lying around the levels and sending them into Tiger's vibrissae or Iggy's scales.
