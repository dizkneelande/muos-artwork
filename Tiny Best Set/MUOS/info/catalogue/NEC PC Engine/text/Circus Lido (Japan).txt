You play as a little chameleon who must clean up around forty levels. To move, you can't jump. You have to use your language to achieve your ends. The first button allows you to swallow monsters and spit them out, like in Bubble Bobble. Except this time you have to send them to carnivorous plants to eradicate them for good. 
 
In Circus Lido impossible to jump, you have to use the other button to stick your tongue out once more in order to pull yourself up via ropes. It follows a rather original handling, but which does not manage to depart from the shadow of Taito's hit. It's a shame, because throughout the levels we take pleasure in finding solutions. Indeed, the game is more of a puzzle game than an action game. Better to think before playing, otherwise you get stuck.
